# CRE-Nstarvation-MATLABcode
This code goes alongside the publication de Lomana et al. 2015 "Transcriptional program for nitrogen starvation-induced lipid accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii". The code should enable FBA based simulation of TAG and biomass differences upon N starvation.

A good start is calling/uncommenting a line of runAll for different experiments.
This script forwards calls to further functions and scripts to analyse, identify, and visualise biomass and TAG yield differences upon nitrogen starvation.
