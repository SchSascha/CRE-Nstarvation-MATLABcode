# CRE-Nstarvation-MATLABcode
This code goes alongside the publication de Lomana et al. 2015 "Transcriptional program for nitrogen starvation-induced lipid accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii". The code should enable FBA based simulation of TAG and biomass differences upon N starvation.

A good start is calling a line of runAll for different experiments.
